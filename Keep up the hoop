Source Code:
import java.util.*;
public class hoop{
  public static String hoopCount(int n){
   //write your logic here
   String s="hai";
   if(n>=10)
    {
        s="Great, now move on to tricks";
    }
    else if(n<10)
    {
        s="Keep at it until you get it";  
    }
    return s;
  }

public static void main(String[] args){
Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
int b=sc.nextInt();
System.out.println(hoopCount(b));
}}
